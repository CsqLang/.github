# Csq
It's an organization whose aim is to develop a programming language to improve coding standards.
  To flourish this dream Aniket Kumar made a repository Csq3 which is very much similar to Python syntax wise and having speed near C++,
it's under development and we are trying to make it's code similar to a typical English sentence. And the syntax of Csq3 is programmable
#Csq4
As Csq3 supports pointers so sometimes memory leaks happens so to prevent it we are developing a new version of Csq in which reference counting will be there.
